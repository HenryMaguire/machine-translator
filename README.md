# MLND Capstone Report

## Instructions:

- Unzip the file "short_data.zip" and make sure the folder is called "short_data", with the pickle files in the directory below.
- If you like, navigate to the `text-preprocessing.ipynb` to investigate the preprocessing script. Be careful when running it as this will overwrite some of the `short_data` folder.
- Go to `machine-translator.ipynb`for the Neural Machine Translation code and the Benchmark model, plus some script to investigate the BLEU scores.
- A full write up to supplement the documentation in the ipython notebooks is available in `report.pdf`.
- `utils.py` contains helper functions, which occasionally give some insight into the workings of the NMT system so may be of interest to the user.
